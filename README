I couldn't find an official and simple Python SDK for sending data to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC), so this is it. One simple file, two lines of code.

Feel free to fork and play around.

Use it:

    > virtualenv /tmp/hec
    > source /tmp/hec/bin/activate
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    from pyHEC import PyHEC
    hec = PyHEC("709FB206-F12B-4017-BACF-DC6DD0FD0DCB", "http://localhost")
    
    event = {"action":"success","message":"individual hello world","event_id":1}
    metadata = {"index":"default", "host":"jonromero"}
    print hec.send(event, metadata)



This is not an official Splunk release.

Ping me @jonromero if you need anything.
